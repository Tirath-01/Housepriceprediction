House Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

House price prediction is a common task in the field of machine learning and data science. In this scenario, we will explore how to solve the problem using two popular regression algorithms: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

Linear Regression:
Linear Regression is a simple and widely used regression algorithm that assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (house price). Here's how you can use Linear Regression for house price prediction:
a. Load the dataset: Start by loading the dataset containing features (e.g., number of bedrooms, square footage, location) and the corresponding house prices.

b. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features if necessary.

c. Split the dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the Linear Regression model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

d. Train the model: Fit the Linear Regression model to the training data. The model will estimate the coefficients for each feature, representing the relationship between the features and the house prices.

e. Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict house prices for the test data points.

f. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the Linear Regression model using evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared value. These metrics measure how well the model predicts house prices compared to the actual prices.

Random Forest Regressor:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is known for its ability to capture complex relationships between features and the target variable. Here's how you can use Random Forest Regressor for house price prediction:
a. Load the dataset: Similarly, load the dataset containing features and corresponding house prices.

b. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features if necessary.

c. Split the dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

d. Train the model: Fit the Random Forest Regressor to the training data. The algorithm will build a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data and a random subset of features.

e. Make predictions: Use the trained Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices for the test data points.

f. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the Random Forest Regressor using evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R-squared value.

Both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor have their strengths and weaknesses. Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model, while Random Forest Regressor can capture complex nonlinear relationships. It is often recommended to try multiple models and compare their performances to choose the best one for a given dataset.
